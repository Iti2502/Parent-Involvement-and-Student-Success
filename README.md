# Parental Involvement and Student Success

This repository contains the code and analysis for a research project exploring the impact of parental involvement on students' academic success, stress levels, and motivation. Using statistical analyses and data visualizations, the study aims to identify patterns in how different types and levels of parental support influence student outcomes.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:
- To investigate the effects of various levels of parental involvement on students' academic performance (measured by CGPA).
- To analyze how different types of support (emotional, financial, academic) relate to students' stress and motivation.
- To assess the impact of parental influence on study choices on student performance and well-being.

### Key Findings
- **Moderate Parental Involvement**: Weekly involvement shows a positive correlation with CGPA, while daily involvement may reduce intrinsic motivation.
- **Emotional vs. Financial Support**: Emotional support has a stronger impact on student well-being than financial support.
- **Autonomy in Study Choice**: Students who independently chose their field of study showed marginally higher motivation, though this did not significantly affect academic performance.

## Methodology

Data was collected through surveys and analyzed using various statistical techniques:
- **ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s HSD**: Used to compare CGPA across different frequencies of parental involvement.
- **T-test**: Applied to assess the impact of independent study choice versus parental influence on CGPA.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Used to determine associations between the frequency of parental involvement and students' reported stress levels.
- **Spearman Correlation**: Employed to analyze the relationship between variables like parental support type and student stress/motivation.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Visualizations (Bar charts, heatmaps, etc.)
- **Plotly**: Interactive plots for in-depth analysis
- **WordCloud**: To visualize common forms of parental support mentioned in surveys
